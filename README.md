# \#HackBrexit: Ministers Under The Influence

Ministers: Under the Influence is a project that came out of the [\#HackBrexit](http://hackbrexit.org/) Hackathon which took place over a weekend. The project has now been pushed into the Hack Brexit accelerator programme and will be developed further over the next few months.

## The Project

The aim of [Ministers: Under the Influence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVbTzTd2ZRs) is to unearth public-but-obscure ministerial data and make it readily available and visually friendly to a common user. We hope to use the project to track spheres of influence within ministerial meetings to encourage transparency in policy-making.

We hope this will help concerned citizens and activists alike get the ful picture of what interests their government is representing.


# Want to get involved?

The Ministers: Under the Influence team will be holding [fortnightly Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Hack-Brexit/) to work on this and [other projects](https://github.com/HackBrexit/WhatTheFact) being featured in the Hack Brexit Accelerator programme.
